![Metaverse crypto](https://i.ibb.co/N6syjB0/4f49bfcb-5ee0-4bef-b89d-1fef3f844916.jpg)

MetaVerse Crypto is a collaborative project to bring the best possible security to the future of social media and communication platform, the meta-verse. This project aims to be the default cryptography library in the AOSP and android based mixed-reality apps. The security we are working on is less reliant on key transfers and with variable strength levels starting from 2048 bit up to 4096 bit. This makes it quantum resistant and quantum proof.

## Motivation
Mixed-reality (MR) applications are gaining interest in a wide range of areas including games, social interaction, design and health-care. However, the potential security and privacy risks that affect collaborative platforms have received limited research attention. MR users face even greater risks as richer information can be gathered using a wide variety of methods. Some of the security and privacy challenges in MR include:

**Physical-virtual alignment**: The alignment of physical and virtual objects can be manipulated by attackers to create misleading or harmful situations for the users. For example, an attacker can overlay a virtual object on a physical obstacle to cause the user to collide with it
**Optical distortion**: The distortion of the optical properties of the MR display can affect the user’s perception and performance. For example, an attacker can alter the brightness, contrast, or color of the MR display to reduce the user’s visibility or induce eye strain2
Object tracking: The tracking of the user’s position, orientation, and movement can be compromised by attackers to infer sensitive information or interfere with the user’s actions. For example, an attacker can spoof or jam the tracking signals to cause the user to lose orientation or control
**Spatial data**: The spatial data that is captured, processed, and transmitted by the MR devices can contain personal or confidential information that can be leaked or tampered with by attackers. For example, an attacker can access or modify the spatial data to reveal the user’s location, identity, or preferences
**3D data**: The 3D data that is generated, rendered, and displayed by the MR devices can be subject to unauthorized copying, modification, or distribution by attackers. For example, an attacker can copy or alter the 3D data to create fake or malicious content1
To address these security and privacy risks, we need a robust and efficient cryptography library that can protect the integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity of the MR data and communications.

**Features**
MetaVerse Crypto is a cryptography library that provides the following features:

**Quantum-resistant algorithms**: The library uses post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms that are designed to resist the attack of a future quantum computer, which could break the security of current public-key algorithms. The library supports four PQC algorithms that are based on structured lattices and hash functions, two families of math problems that could resist a quantum computer’s assault. 
**Variable strength levels**: The library allows the user to choose the security level of the PQC algorithms, ranging from 2048 bit to 4096 bit. The higher the security level, the more resistant the algorithm is to quantum and classical attacks, but also the more computational and communication resources it requires. The library provides a trade-off analysis of the security and performance of each algorithm and each security level, to help the user make an informed decision.

**Key transfer reduction**: The library reduces the reliance on key transfers, which are vulnerable to interception, replay, or man-in-the-middle attacks. The library uses techniques such as key derivation, key agreement, and key encapsulation to generate or exchange keys securely and efficiently. The library also supports ephemeral and forward-secure keys, which limit the exposure and impact of key compromise.
